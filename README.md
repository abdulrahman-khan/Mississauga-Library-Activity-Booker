# Mississauga Library Activity Booker

An application that lets you view resource availability at Mississauga's Community Centers, Libraries, and recreational facilities.

The official Mississauga site for booking resources is unintuitive: finding an available time slot often takes 15 minutes for a process that should take just a few clicks.

This application addresses that problem by providing a UI that **the official site should have had**. It clearly shows available times and gives direct links to the resource, making it faster and easier to find what you need.

> **Note:** You cannot book resources through the app yet, as library login credentials are required. The app currently lets you see availability and provides a link to the official site, where booking can be completed in a few clicks.

The app connects directly to the [Active Mississauga backend API](https://anc.ca.apm.activecommunities.com/activemississauga/), ensuring that the availability data is always up to date.

## Features
- View facility availability in Mississauga Libraries, Community Centers, and recreational facilities.
